### My Focus 🧐
I have experience working in the back-end, front-end, and Full-stack development. I am still figuring out which I enjoy the most. I am always open to exploring new technologies and figuring out what I enjoy the most. I have more experience working in back-end development but I am trying to gain more experience in the front end before I decide which I enjoy the most. 


### My Background 👩🏽‍🏫 📚 🎓
I graduated from a four-year university with a B.A.  in Educational studies with a focus on curriculum, instruction, and Equity concentration and a minor in diversity studies. During my undergraduate degree, I took all types of courses ranging from STEM to humanities courses. I also worked with non-profits and k-16 education in multiple positions. I enjoyed working with people, mentoring, teaching, and empowering but I missed problem-solving. After I graduated I felt stuck so I started to learn to code. I found out that software development could be used to create tools for medicine, climate change, and many more industries. I found out that software engineering is a place you can learn from one another, teach, empower, and create solutions to bigger issues. Thats when I knew that software engineering was for me!
